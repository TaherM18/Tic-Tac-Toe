# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project aims to create a unique and scalable twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Designed for flexibility and enjoyment, it allows players to choose from multiple grid sizes (3x3, 5x5, and 7x7), offering new strategic depth compared to the traditional version.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Size**: Players can select from 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 grids, changing the strategic dynamics of the game.
- **Two-Player Gameplay**: A turn-based system where players alternate placing their marks on the grid.
- **Variable Win Conditions**:
  - 3x3: Three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
  - 5x5: Four in a row
  - 7x7: Four in a row
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean design with indicators for current player turns and game outcomes (win, loss, draw).
- **Game Reset Option**: Easily restart the game without closing the application.

## Technology Stack
- **Unity Engine**: For development and deployment.
- **C#**: For scripting game logic and mechanics.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand to allow more than two players.
- Introduce AI opponents with varying difficulty levels.
- Add special rules or power-ups to increase gameplay complexity.
